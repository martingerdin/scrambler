#' Scramble a dataset
#'
#' This is the workhorse function of the `scramble` package. It takes a dataset
#' as input and returns a scrambled dataset. The scrambled dataset includes the
#' same columns as the original dataset but these have been resampled in such a
#' way that the associations between columns present in the original dataset
#' are lost.
#' @param data Data.frame. The original data. No default.
#' @export
scramble <- function(data) {
